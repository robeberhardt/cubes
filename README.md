## cubes

#### time spent
~ 6 hours reading through tutorials

~ 2 hours getting the basic pipeline working

~ 2 more hours getting simple particles working

~ 1/2 hour adding slider UI

#### known issues
I wasn't able to fix the viewport clipping, need to dig some more into the relationship between the OpenGL layer, viewport and the projection matrix, I think

on my iPhone 6S+, maintaining 60fps until we get > 5000 cubes

#### third-party code
everything in the Utils group (matrix and vector structs, math helpers, shader loader)
